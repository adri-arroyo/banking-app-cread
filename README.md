# Banking Application (CCA-003 Final Project)

The objective of this project is to develop a banking system in Java that simulates the basic operations of a bank. The system will allow the creation and management of users, bank accounts (savings and current), financial transactions, and the detailed recording of all operations carried out.




# Features

+ **User management:** create, update, and delete user accounts
+ **Account management:** create, update, and delete savings and current accounts
+  **Financial transactions:** deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts 
+ **Recording of operations:** detailed recording of all transactions and operations carried out 
+ **Data imports:** extraction of pre-existing account information from external files (.csv), allowing for seamless integration with existing data

The program was designed using object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Data structures such as arrays, lists, and maps were used to store and manipulate data. Exception handling was implemented to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during system operation.

The system can be tested using the provided _Main.java_ or _MainAccounts.java_ files to ensure that it meets the requirements and behaves as expected. The tests are meant to ensure that the system is secure and resistant to common vulnerabilities.
